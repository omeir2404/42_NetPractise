This goal of this project is to learn and understand how subnetting works and all the theory needed to propperly understand network configurations.
by running the index.html file a virtual configuration platform is launched including 10 levels (varying in difficulty from lowest(1) to highest(10)) and each student has to rectify them and save the correct configuration.
these correct files need to be delivered and the student must then solve (without any help) three random cofigurations in under 15 minutes to complete the project.
